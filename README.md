# ChipDesigneXecution

The goal is to build an infrastructure for each individual Chip Designer to manage the practices (knowledges) and the daily work.

It could also be used for small team or big organization.

Our system architecture are still in 0.x status. We will change the implementation if there is a simplier way.

"cdx" is the shortname of ChipDesigneXecution.
